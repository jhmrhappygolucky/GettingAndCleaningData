+ CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
+ The "run_analysis.R" script is used to load the ".txt" files into R for further transformation and analysis. These files are uncompressed in the root folder and the test and train folders.
+ The output of the above R script is called "finalyTidySet.txt" and was uploaded in the root folder of this project
